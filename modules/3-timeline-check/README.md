## 3. Pace Gap Reality Check (“How far is my goal from my current ability?”)

- **Inputs**
  - Current sustainable pace (from recent race / estimator)
  - Goal pace (from Goal Pace Converter)
  - Time remaining until race day (weeks)
  - Runner experience level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)

- **Outputs**
  - Pace gap (seconds per kilometer)
  - Gap category (small / medium / large)
  - Neutral explanation of what this gap typically represents for runners at a similar level

- **Evidence basis**
  - Gap interpretation and improvement ranges are informed by endurance training literature showing
    diminishing returns with higher training status.
  - In particular, experience-level differences are grounded in findings from:
    *Programming Interval Training to Optimize Time-Trial Performance:  
    A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis*  
    (time-trial performance improvements differ substantially between less-trained and trained runners)

- **Role in the toolkit**
  - Bridges **current capability** (Race Time Estimator) and **goal demand** (Goal Pace Converter)
  - Feeds expectation context into Timeline Check and Progress Trendline

**Assumptions:**

- Using an assumed training block of 8 weeks 

- Possible improvement over a 8 week training block with consistent training

  - Beginner: 4%-6% improvement
  - Intermediate: 3%-4% improvement
  - Advanced: 2% improvement
