## 4. Progress Trendline  
**“Am I trending toward my goal over time?”**

### Purpose
The Progress Trendline extends single-point estimates into a **longitudinal view**, helping runners understand whether their training trajectory is moving closer to (or further from) their race-day goal as the marathon build progresses.

Rather than judging readiness from isolated results, this module emphasizes **direction, consistency, and context over time**.

---

### Inputs
- Periodic check-ins representing current sustainable capability  
  (e.g. recent race results, key workouts, or updated estimates)
- Check-in date (timestamp)
- Goal pace (from Goal Pace Converter)
- Target race date
- Runner experience level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)

---

### Outputs
- A visual trendline showing estimated marathon capability over time
- Forward projection ranges to race day:
  - **Conservative**
  - **Optimistic**
- Contextual alignment cues describing how the current trend relates to the goal pace

---

### Evidence basis
- Trend visualization reflects established **performance-monitoring practice**, where short-term variability is filtered to reveal underlying adaptation trends rather than day-to-day noise.
- Forward projections reuse the same improvement-rate assumptions and scenario logic defined in **Module 3 (Goal–Timeline Expectation Check)** to ensure internal consistency.
- Scenario-based projection ranges are informed by endurance-training literature showing:
  - diminishing returns as training status increases
  - performance gains occurring within **probabilistic bands**, not linear progressions

---

### Role within the toolkit
- Extends snapshot-based evaluation into a **longitudinal perspective**
- Transforms isolated results into directional context across a marathon build
- Maintains expectation-setting continuity between Timeline Check and race day
- Serves as the primary **repeat check-in and reflection mechanism** within the toolkit

# Progress Trendline – Improvement Model

## Overview
Module 4 uses a **diminishing-returns improvement model** to project how a runner’s sustainable pace may evolve from their most recent check-in to race day.

Rather than assuming constant linear improvement, the model reflects a well-established training reality:

> **Performance improves fastest early in a training cycle, then gains gradually slow even when training continues.**

This is why the projection lines curve and flatten over time instead of extending as straight lines.

---

## Why not use hard “caps”?
Earlier versions of the model applied a maximum total improvement (for example, “no more than 10% overall”).  
While safe, hard caps introduce artificial behavior:

- Progress appears to stop abruptly  
- Long training timelines feel unrealistic  
- Visual trends flatten suddenly instead of gradually  

To better reflect real physiological adaptation, Module 4 replaces hard caps with **rate tapering**.

---

## Training block framework
All projections are based on **8-week training blocks**, a common unit in endurance programming.

Each runner level uses a reference improvement range per block:

| Runner level | Typical improvement per 8 weeks |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Beginner | ~4–6% |
| Intermediate | ~3–4% |
| Advanced | ~2% |

These ranges are **contextual benchmarks**, not guarantees.

---

## Diminishing returns across blocks
Instead of applying the same gain repeatedly, each successive block contributes slightly less improvement than the one before it.

Conceptually:
- Block 1: 100% of the rate  
- Block 2: ~95% of block 1  
- Block 3: ~90–95%  
- And so on…

In simplified form:
