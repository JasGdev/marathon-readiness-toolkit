## 4. Progress Trendline (“Am I trending toward my goal over time?”)

- **Inputs**
  - Periodic check-ins representing current capability (recent race results, key workouts, or updated estimates)
  - Check-in date (timestamp)
  - Goal pace (from Goal Pace Converter)
  - Target race date
  - Runner experience level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)

- **Outputs**
  - Smoothed trendline of estimated marathon capability over time
  - Projection ranges to race day (conservative / typical / optimistic)
  - Neutral alignment labels describing how the current trend relates to the goal

- **Evidence basis**
  - Trend smoothing reflects established performance-monitoring practice, where short-term variability is filtered to reveal underlying adaptation trends.
  - Forward projections reuse the same improvement-rate assumptions and scenario logic defined in Module 3 (Goal–Timeline Expectation Check).
  - Scenario-based projection ranges are informed by endurance-training literature showing diminishing returns as training status increases and performance gains occur within probabilistic bands rather than linear progressions.

- **Role in the toolkit**
  - Extends snapshot-based evaluation into a longitudinal perspective
  - Transforms isolated results into directional context across a marathon build
  - Provides expectation-setting continuity between Timeline Check and Race D ay
  - Serves as the primary repeat check-in and reflection mechanism

# Progress Trendline – Improvement Model

## Overview
Module 4 uses a **diminishing-returns improvement model** to project how a runner’s sustainable pace may evolve from their most recent check-in to race day.

Rather than assuming constant linear improvement, the model reflects a well-established training reality:

> **Performance improves fastest early in a training cycle, then gains gradually slow even when training continues.**

This is why the projection lines curve and flatten over time instead of extending as straight lines.

---

## Why not use hard “caps”?
Earlier versions of the model applied a maximum total improvement (for example, “no more than 10% overall”).  
While safe, hard caps introduce artificial behavior:

- Progress appears to stop abruptly  
- Long training timelines feel unrealistic  
- Visual trends flatten suddenly instead of gradually  

To better match real adaptation patterns, Module 4 replaces hard caps with **rate tapering**.

---

## Training block framework
All projections are based on **8-week training blocks**, a common unit in endurance programming.

Each runner level has a reference improvement range per block:

| Runner level | Typical improvement per 8 weeks |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Beginner | ~4–6% |
| Intermediate | ~3–4% |
| Advanced | ~2% |

These ranges are **contextual benchmarks**, not guarantees.

---

## Diminishing returns across blocks
Instead of applying the same gain repeatedly, each successive block contributes slightly less improvement than the one before it.

Conceptually:
- Block 1: 100% of the rate  
- Block 2: ~95% of block 1  
- Block 3: ~90–95%  
- And so on…

In simplified form:

### total improvement ≈ rate × (1 + decay + decay² + …)

This produces:
- Faster early improvements  
- Gradual flattening closer to race day  
- More realistic long-term projections  

A safety floor prevents mathematically impossible outcomes (e.g., extreme pace reductions).

## Evidence-based rationale
This modeling approach aligns with findings summarized in:

**Programming Interval Training to Optimize Time-Trial Performance**  
*A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis*

Key conclusions reflected in this model:

- Interval and endurance training reliably improve time-trial performance  
- **The largest gains typically occur early in a training cycle**  
- As athletes become more trained, **additional improvements diminish**  
- Adaptation follows a nonlinear pattern even with continued high-quality training  

The curved projection reflects this adaptive slowdown observed across studies, rather than assuming constant linear gains.

## Interpreting the projection lines
After your most recent check-in, the chart shows:

- **Low-end estimate (orange)**  
  A conservative trajectory assuming slower adaptation  

- **High-end estimate (green)**  
  An optimistic trajectory assuming stronger training response  

Both lines:
- Start from your actual current pace  
- Use the same diminishing-returns logic  
- Extend only to your selected race date  

If a goal pace is set, it appears as a horizontal reference line for context — not as a promise.

## What this tool is (and isn’t)
**This tool is designed for orientation and expectation-setting.**

It helps answer:
- “Is my current trajectory broadly aligned with my goal?”  
- “Is the gap shrinking as training progresses?”  

It does **not**:
- Predict exact outcomes  
- Replace coaching or structured training plans  
- Assume perfect consistency or ideal conditions  

The most meaningful signal comes from **repeated check-ins over time**, not any single projection.
