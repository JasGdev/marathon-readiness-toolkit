## 4. Progress Trendline  
**“Am I trending toward my goal over time?”**

---

### Purpose
The Progress Trendline extends single-point estimates into a **longitudinal view**, helping runners understand whether their training trajectory is moving closer to (or further from) their race-day goal as the marathon build progresses.

Rather than judging readiness from isolated results, this module emphasizes **direction, consistency, and context over time**.

---

### Inputs
- **Periodic check-ins** representing current sustainable capability  
  (recent races, key workouts, or updated estimates)
- **Check-in date**
- **Target race date**
- **Goal pace** (optional)
- **Runner experience level**  
  Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced

---

### Outputs
- **Visual trendline** of sustainable pace over time
- **Forward projection bands** from the latest check-in to race day:
  - **Conservative (low-end)**
  - **Optimistic (high-end)**
- **Goal pace reference line** (if provided)

---

### Evidence Basis
- Trend visualization follows established **performance monitoring practice**, prioritizing trajectory over isolated data points.
- Forward projections reuse the same improvement assumptions as **Module 3 (Goal–Timeline Expectation Check)** to ensure internal consistency.
- Scenario ranges reflect endurance-training research showing:
  - diminishing returns as fitness increases
  - performance gains occurring within probabilistic ranges rather than linear paths

---

### Role Within the Toolkit
- Extends snapshot estimates into a **longitudinal perspective**
- Provides context for interpreting progress across a marathon build
- Reinforces realistic expectation-setting between present capability and race day
- Acts as the primary **repeat check-in and reflection tool**

## Improvement Model (Module 4)

### Overview
Module 4 uses a **diminishing-returns improvement model** to project how a runner’s sustainable pace may evolve from their most recent check-in to race day.

Improvements are modeled over time rather than assumed to progress linearly.

> Performance typically improves fastest early, then adapts more slowly even with continued training.

This behavior is reflected visually as **curved, flattening projection lines**.

---

### Training Block Framework
All projections are based on **8-week training blocks**, a standard unit in endurance programming.

| Runner level | Typical improvement per 8 weeks |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Beginner | ~4–6% |
| Intermediate | ~3–4% |
| Advanced | ~2% |

These values are **contextual reference ranges**, not guarantees.

---

### Diminishing Returns Across Time
Instead of applying the same improvement rate repeatedly, each successive training block contributes **slightly less improvement than the previous one**.

- Early blocks contribute the largest gains
- Later blocks taper gradually
- Improvement slows smoothly rather than stopping abruptly

This reflects physiological adaptation limits observed in endurance training.

---

### Smooth Maximum Improvement Constraint
To prevent unrealistic long-term projections while avoiding artificial flatlines, the model applies a **smooth asymptotic cap** on total improvement.

| Runner level | Approx. maximum total improvement |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Beginner | ~14% |
| Intermediate | ~10% |
| Advanced | ~6% |

This ensures:
- Projections remain conservative
- Long timelines stay realistic
- Projection lines never collapse or snap to the same value

---

### Key Design Principles
- **Non-linear**: Improvement slows naturally over time
- **Non-compounding pace math**: Pace is reduced by accumulated improvement, not multiplied each step
- **Scenario-based**: Conservative and optimistic paths reflect realistic uncertainty
- **Visually interpretable**: Curves convey adaptation better than straight lines
