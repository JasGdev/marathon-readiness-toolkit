## 3. Pace Gap Reality Check  
**“How far is my goal from my current ability?”**

### Inputs
- Current sustainable pace (from a recent race, key workout, or the Race Time Estimator)
- Goal pace (from the Goal Pace Converter)
- Time remaining until race day (weeks)
- Runner experience level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)

---

### Outputs
- **Pace gap** between current ability and goal (seconds per kilometer)
- **Gap category** (small / medium / large)
- A **neutral explanation** of what this gap typically represents for runners at a similar level and stage

---

### Evidence basis
This module is grounded in endurance-training research showing that **performance improvements follow a diminishing-returns pattern**, rather than increasing at a constant linear rate.

Findings summarized in:

**Programming Interval Training to Optimize Time-Trial Performance**  
*A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis*

indicate that:
- Structured interval and endurance training reliably improve time-trial performance
- **The largest performance gains tend to occur early in a training cycle**
- As fitness improves, **each additional training block produces smaller gains**
- More trained runners show **slower rates of improvement** than less-trained runners, even with similar training consistency

These findings support modeling improvement as **front-loaded and gradually tapering**, rather than assuming the same percentage gain can be repeated indefinitely.

---

### Assumptions
- Progress is evaluated using a standardized **8-week training block** reference
- Each runner level has a typical improvement *range* per block:
  - **Beginner:** ~4–6%  
  - **Intermediate:** ~3–4%  
  - **Advanced:** ~2%
- Over multiple training blocks, the **effective improvement rate gradually decays**:
  - Early blocks contribute more adaptation
  - Later blocks contribute less, even if training remains consistent

This decay reflects biological adaptation limits (neuromuscular efficiency, aerobic ceiling, recovery cost), not reduced effort or discipline.

The Pace Gap Reality Check uses these tapered assumptions to contextualize whether a given gap is commonly achievable within the available time — **not to guarantee or deny success**.

### Role in the toolkit
- Bridges **current capability** (Race Time Estimator) and **goal demand** (Goal Pace Converter)
- Provides realism and emotional grounding before timeline-based evaluation
- Feeds expectation context into:
  - **Timeline Check**
  - **Progress Trendline**
- Helps runners interpret goal difficulty **without judgment or false reassurance**
