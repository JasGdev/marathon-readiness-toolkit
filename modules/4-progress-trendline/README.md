## 4. Progress Trendline (“Am I trending toward my goal over time?”)

- **Inputs**
  - Periodic check-ins representing current capability (recent race results, key workouts, or updated estimates)
  - Check-in date (timestamp)
  - Goal pace (from Goal Pace Converter)
  - Target race date
  - Runner experience level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)

- **Outputs**
  - Smoothed trendline of estimated marathon capability over time
  - Projection ranges to race day (conservative / typical / optimistic)
  - Neutral alignment labels describing how the current trend relates to the goal

- **Evidence basis**
  - Trend smoothing reflects established performance-monitoring practice, where short-term variability is filtered to reveal underlying adaptation trends.
  - Forward projections reuse the same improvement-rate assumptions and scenario logic defined in Module 3 (Goal–Timeline Expectation Check).
  - Scenario-based projection ranges are informed by endurance-training literature showing diminishing returns as training status increases and performance gains occur within probabilistic bands rather than linear progressions.

- **Role in the toolkit**
  - Extends snapshot-based evaluation into a longitudinal perspective
  - Transforms isolated results into directional context across a marathon build
  - Provides expectation-setting continuity between Timeline Check and Race D ay
  - Serves as the primary repeat check-in and reflection mechanism

**Assumptions:**

- Check-ins represent estimates of current sustainable capability rather than exact fitness
- Using an assumed training block length of 8 weeks
- Possible improvement over an 8 week training block with consistent training
  - Beginner: 4%–6% improvement
  - Intermediate: 3%–4% improvement
  - Advanced: ~2% improvement
- Projections describe possible future ranges, not guaranteed outcomes
- Short-term plateaus or regressions are treated as normal within long training cycles
